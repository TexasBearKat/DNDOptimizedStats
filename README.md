# DNDOptimizedStats

I love D&D, and I like to roll my stats. The worst part about rolling my stats is having bad luck.
This program strives to eliminate luck from the equation. It runs thousands of rolls per second and selects a set of rolls for you.

## How to Use

Variables
Target: The number you want (or higher)\

Have fun, and know that with great power comes great responsibility.
